# ESTIMATION-OF-RETURNS-SPILLOVER-AMONG-EMERGING-NATIONS
Novelty of the research work:
We were able to find the relation between the different geopolitical disasters and their impact on oil prices, which further effect emerging economies

Geopolitical turmoil → Oil price fluctuation → Spillover to stock market indices

We got to check the relation between China and COVID-19 through this research. It is in accordance with the popular beliefs that COVID-19 did not affect the Chinese economy much. Such revelation wasn’t noticed in previous papers

Scope for Further Research:
We wish to compare the effect of WTI Crude Oil as well, then compare the results with Brent Oil results to gauge which Oil COmmodity has a more profound spillover effect on the emerging countries.
We also wish to include the Middle-Eastern countries, but the time frame of data for them is too less to consider it in our current study
